# Encrypted Command Prank

## About

This a little script I made to prank some of my friends. People would ask me for help with programming, perfect opprotunity for a prank. I would send them a piece of code, use this script to encrypt it, send it and tell them to run it, and then it would open a funny image I found on the internet.  

## Dependencies

Python3 will need to be installed

## Usage  

To encrypt a piece of code just run:

```bash
./prank.py -c "print('Hello World')"
```

more options can be found with `-h`

```bash
./prank.py -h
```
